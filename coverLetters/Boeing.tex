%Introduction
I have recently graduated with a master's degree from Michigan Tech in applied mathematics after
completing a B.S. in physics and mathematics.
Upon achieving this, I entered a Ph.D. program at the University of MN, but have since
decided that this degree program did not fit my long term interests.
%where I found the job posting
While searching for career opportunities, I discovered your opening for an
Applied Mathematician via your website.

%argument why I'm a good fit
I am looking to contribute to Boeing while utilizing my entire educational background.
My undergraduate in degree led me to study applied mathematics due to a strong
interest in underlying mathematical models in physical processes.
Numerical methods then became one of my primary interests in my studies as a graduate.
My education and internship have also honed my skill when writing technical reports.
These communication skills have been further honed through teaching courses to undergraduates
throughout my education.

%Closing
My educational background in both mathematics and physics will allow 
me to approach positions with the technical skills required and a thorough understanding
of the underlying physical assumptions.
Furthermore, my teaching and educational experiences will allow me to 
effectively communicate with all audiences.
Thank you for your time and consideration, and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
