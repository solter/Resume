%Introduction
I have recently graduated with a master's degree from Michigan Tech in applied mathematics after
completing a B.S. in physics and mathematics.
Upon achieving this, I entered a Ph.D. program at the University of MN, but have since
decided that this degree program did not fit my long term interests.
%where I found the job posting
While searching for career opportunities, I discovered your opening for a Research Scientist
on your website.

%argument why I'm a good fit
I am looking to contribute to Numerica while utilizing my entire educational background.
Numerical methods have been one of my primary interests in my studies as a graduate,
which will be leveraged to contribute to the development and usage of efficient software.
My education and internship have also honed my skill when writing technical reports.
These communication skills have been further honed through teaching courses to undergraduates
throughout my education.
Furthermore, my undergraduate degree in physics has given me a solid understanding of the
physical processes which lie behind many mathematical models.

%Closing
My educational background in both mathematics and physics will allow 
me to approach positions with the technical skills required and a thorough understanding
of the underlying physical processes.
Furthermore, my teaching and educational experiences will allow me to 
effectively communicate with all audiences.
Thank you for your time and consideration, and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
