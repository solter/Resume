%Introduction
I have recently graduated with a master's degree from Michigan Tech in applied mathematics after
having completed a B.S. in physics and mathematics.
Upon achieving this, I entered a Ph.D. program at the University of MN, but have since
decided that this degree program did not fit my long term interests and have decided to
employ my skills rather than continue to build them.
%where I found the job posting
Using Michigan Tech's career services I was alerted to your opening in the position of a
research engineer.

%argument why I'm a good fit
I am interested in positions for which I could contribute utilizing my entire educational background.
Numerical methods have been one of my primary interest in my studies as a graduate,
which would be leveraged to contribute to the development and usage of efficient software in a 
variety of languages (especially C, python, and matlab).
This has also provided the experience of writing technical reports allowing me to 
communicate these methods to a technical audience.
Teaching throughout my education has honed these communication skills 
for broader audiences with less of a technical background.
Furthermore, my undergraduate degree in physics has given me a solid understanding of the
physical processes which lie behind many of the software applications.

%Closing
Thus I believe my educational background in both mathematics and physics would allow 
me to approach positions with a not just the technical skills required but a holistic approach,
while my teaching and educational experiences would allow me to 
effectively communication with all audiences.
Thank you for you consideration and time, and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
