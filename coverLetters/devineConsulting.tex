%Introduction
I have recently graduated with a master's degree from Michigan Tech in applied mathematics after
completing a B.S. in physics and mathematics.
Upon achieving this, I entered a Ph.D. program at the University of MN, but have since
decided that this degree program did not fit my long term interests.
%where I found the job posting
I uncovered the position for Data Assimilation Specialist at MathJob.com,
and that I would be a great fit for the position given my educational background
and strong personal interest in space science.

%argument why I'm a good fit
I will contribute to DeVine Consulting utilizing my entire educational background.
My B.S. and M.S. in applied mathematics has provided me with extensive experience developing
and implementing numerical algortihms in Matlab.
Furthermore I have experience with BASH scripting, C and Python programming
for both educational and personal projects.
Beyond my technical qualifications, I have had a life long fascination with
space science - following it closely as well as having had the opportunity
as an intern at NASA.

%Closing
My educational background in mathematics will allow 
me to approach this position with the technical skills required
while my undergraduate in physics and personal fascination with space
will provide a strong foundation for the scientific principles necessary
to understand the data.
Furthermore, having taught throughout my education along with compiling reports
throughout my education will allow me to effectively communicate with all audiences.
Thank you for your time and consideration, and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
