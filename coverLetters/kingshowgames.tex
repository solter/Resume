%Introduction
I have recently graduated with a master's degree from Michigan Tech in applied mathematics after
completing a B.S. in physics and mathematics.
Upon achieving this, I entered a Ph.D. program at the University of MN, but have since
decided that this degree program did not fit my long term interests.
%where I found the job posting
I found the position for Mathematician with King Show Games via Monster.

%argument why I'm a good fit
I will contribute to a King Show Games through the use of my entire educational background.
Numerical methods have been one of my primary interests in my studies as a graduate,
which will be leveraged to contribute to the development and usage of efficient software.
My education and internship have also honed my skill when writing technical reports.
These communication skills have been further honed through teaching courses to undergraduates
throughout my education.
Furthermore, my undergraduate degree in physics has given me a solid understanding of
modeling processes and understanding the nuance involved in realistically simplifying complex topics
to mathematical models.

%Closing
My educational background in both mathematics and physics will allow 
me to approach this position with the technical skills required.
Furthermore, my teaching and educational experiences will allow me to 
effectively communicate with all team members and audiences.
Thank you for your time and consideration, and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
