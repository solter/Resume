%Introduction
I discovered your job posting for Applied Mathematical Optimization Software Engineer
via indeed.com,
 and am a great fit for the position.
I have recently graduated with a master's degree from Michigan Tech in applied mathematics after
completing a B.S. in physics and mathematics.

%argument why I'm a good fit
Utilizing my entire educational background will allow me to immediately
contribute to Mathworks.
As a graduate student in mathematics, one of my primary interests was the study and
implementation of numerical methods in linear algebra, partial differential equations,
and optimization problems.
These methods are also something I find fascinating, and my continuing desire to explore
the state of the art will help MathWorks stay on the cutting edge.
Throughout my academic career I often utilized \textit{MATLAB} for implementing these methods,
and have also used object oriented languages (JAVA, Python) and scripting (BASH) extensively.

%If technical writing
%%My education and internship have also honed my skill when writing technical reports.
%%These communication skills have been further honed through teaching courses to undergraduates
%%throughout my education.
%If strong connection to physics
%%Furthermore, my undergraduate degree in physics has given me a solid understanding of the
%%physical processes which lie behind many of the mathematical models.

%Closing
My educational background in both mathematics and physics will allow 
me to approach positions with the technical skills required as well as a broad perspective.
Furthermore, my inherit interest in numerical methods will guarantee a passionate employee
who stays aware of and pushes the boundaries of the state of art forward.
Thank you for your time and consideration, and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
