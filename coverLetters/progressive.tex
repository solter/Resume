%Introduction
I have recently graduated with a master's degree from Michigan Tech in applied mathematics after
completing a B.S. in physics and mathematics.
I uncovered the position for Data Analyst with progressive through careerbuilder.com.
%where I found the job posting


%argument why I'm a good fit
I will contribute to progressive utilizing my entire educational background.
Numerical methods have been one of my primary interests in my studies as a graduate,
which will be leveraged to contribute to the development and usage of efficient software.
My education strongly emphasized manipulating datasets with matlab as well as
computationally solving mathematical problems arising in optimization and linear algebra.
Most recently I was a research assistant at the university of MN, during which I employed
these skills to quickly pick up and contribute to analyzing large data sets on materials.

%Closing
My educational background in both mathematics and physics will allow 
me to approach positions with the technical skills required and a thorough understanding
of the underlying physical assumptions.
Furthermore, my ability and curiosity to develop new skills will prove invaluable
at staying at the cutting edge of data analytics techniques.
Thank you for your time and consideration, and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
