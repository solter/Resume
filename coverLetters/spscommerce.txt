To whom it may concern,

I have recently graduated with a master's degree from Michigan Tech in applied mathematics after
completing a B.S. in physics and mathematics.
I would be a great fit for the research programmer position
at SPS Commerce given my educational background
and strong personal interest in algorithm development.

I will contribute to SPS Commerce utilizing my entire educational background.
My B.S. and M.S. in applied mathematics has provided me with extensive experience developing
and implementing numerical algorithms using Matlab and C.
Furthermore my B.S. in physics has provided me a broad background
problem solving utilizing mathematical models.
My education and personal experience have further provided me with
extensive experience working in a Linux environment and scripting
jobs using BASH.
Furthermore I find tackling new problems invigorating, and enjoy
the process of diving into new fields of inquiry to quickly learn
enough to contribute to the field.
Beyond my academic background I have participated in BonzAI Brawl in which
AIs were implemented in JAVA, as well as
creating particle simulations using Python.
Recently I was a research assistant at the university of MN, during which I employed
these skills to quickly pick up and contribute to analyzing large data sets on materials.
Beyond my technical qualifications, I have had a life long fascination with
pushing the boundaries of humanity's capabilities.

My educational background in mathematics and personal fascination
with implementing algorithms in software will allow 
me to approach this position with the technical skills required.
Furthermore, having taught throughout my education along with compiling reports
throughout my education will allow me to effectively communicate and
collaborate with a wide variety of professionals.
Thank you for your time and consideration, and hope to hear from you soon.


Sincerely,

Peter M. Solfest
