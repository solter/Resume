I have recently graduated with a master's degree from Michigan Tech in applied mathematics after
completing a B.S. in physics and mathematics.
I would be a great fit at Virgin Galactic given my educational background
and strong personal interest in space science.

I will contribute to Virgin Galactic utilizing my entire educational background.
My B.S. and M.S. in applied mathematics has provided me with extensive experience developing
and implementing numerical algorithms in Matlab and C.
Furthermore my B.S. in physics has provided me a broad background in the physics
underlying many of the useful applications for the mathematical models.
My education and personal experience has further provided me with
extensive experience working in a Linux environment and scripting
jobs using BASH.
Furthermore I find tackling new problems invigorating, and have
participated in programming AIs in the annual BonzAI Brawl using JAVA and
have created many particle simulations in my free time using Python among
other projects.
Beyond my technical qualifications, I have had a life long fascination with
space science - following it closely as well as having had the opportunity
as an intern at NASA.

My educational background in mathematics will allow 
me to approach this position with the technical skills required
while my undergraduate in physics and personal fascination with space
will provide a strong foundation for the scientific principles necessary
to understand the data.
Furthermore, having taught throughout my education along with compiling reports
throughout my education will allow me to effectively communicate and
collaborate with a wide variety of professionals.
Thank you for your time and consideration, and hope to hear from you soon.
