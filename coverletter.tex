%Introduction
I have recently graduated with a degree from Michigan Tech in applied mathematics.
Upon achieving this, I entered a Ph.D. program at the University of MN, but have since
decided that this degree program did not fit my long term interests and have decided to
employ my skills rather than continue to build them.
One resourse I have been using to find a job where I could be of benefit is usajobs.gov,
which made me aware of this recent opening at NIST for a mathematician with the high-speed
measurements group.

%argument why I'm a good fit
I am interested in this position because I could contribute via
utilizing my entire educational background.
Numerical methods have been one of my primary interest in my studies as a graduate,
which would be leveraged to provide effecient software.
Furthermore my undergraduate degree in physics has provided me with a solid background
in not just physical instrumentation, but experience with calibrations through lab coursework
(both as a TA and a student).
More over, I have developed calibration software for a radiation shield during an intership at NASA (using C++).


%Closing
Thus I believe my educational background in both physics and mathematics would allow me to approach 
this position with a not just the technical skills required but a holistic approach.
Thank you for you consideration and time - and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerly,
